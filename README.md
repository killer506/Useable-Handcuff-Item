This Script is for Ox_inventory and AK47 Crime script, It allows the use of handcuffs as an item to handcuff someone with their script, do note its only set to do a hard cuffing when you use them and soft cuffing is still used as they have it setup.

Changelog: added functions to allow uncuffing and receiving handcuffs back when you go to uncuff someone via the command or by ox_target
